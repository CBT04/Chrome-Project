# Chrome Notepad

This is a very basic text editor chrome extension project developed using html, css and javascript as a way for me to learn a bit of javascript.

V1.0 
- Created an undo button that uses a stack to store save states.
- Created a save functionality that converts the text area content into a .txt file.

Potential improvements 
- Create a service worker that will store any data input and retrieve it when the popup is reopened. Currently all input data is lost if the popup is closed.
- Add functionality to load an existing txt file.
- Add buttons for copying and pasting content.
- Add the option to change the background colour.
